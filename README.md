# Analysis of Simple Projectile Motion Using MATLAB
This project involves calculating various metrics associated with simple projectile motion. It provides graph based visualization showing relation between different quantities associated with the trajectory of simple projectile. A bonus visualization is provided in the end which shows ranges of projectile for different angle of projections keeping rest of the quantities unchanged.
